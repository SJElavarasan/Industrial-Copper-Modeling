# Industrial Copper Modeling

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for modeling industrial copper production. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can forecast copper production in industrial settings. The models will be trained on historical data and will aim to provide insights into future copper production trends.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Elavarasan sundaram/industrial-copper-modeling.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd industrial-copper-modeling
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the models and generate predictions, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory if you're not already there:

    ```bash
    cd industrial-copper-modeling
    ```

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary inputs.

## Data

The data used for this project is stored in the `data` directory. It includes historical records of industrial copper production, as well as relevant features such as time, production volume, and environmental factors.

## Models

Several machine learning models are implemented in this project, including but not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

These models are trained on historical data to predict future copper production.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score. The evaluation results are presented in the `evaluation` directory.
